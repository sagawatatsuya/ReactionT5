All Flax model weights were used when initializing T5ForConditionalGeneration.

Some weights of T5ForConditionalGeneration were not initialized from the Flax model and are newly initialized: ['decoder.embed_tokens.weight', 'encoder.embed_tokens.weight']
You should probably TRAIN this model on a down-stream task to be able to use it for predictions and inference.
