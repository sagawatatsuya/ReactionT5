# transformer-chemical-reaction-prediciton
We trained T5 and DeBERTa on SMILES from ZINC and PubChem-10m using the task of masked-language modeling (MLM). These models can be used for the prediction of molecules' property, reaction, or interaction with proteins by changing the way of finetuning. Here, we conducted chemical reaction prediction, where if models were given a product, they generate reactants witch is nessesary for the reaction.
